# This scripts compares in a non-parametric way two independent samples and tests if they are different.
# The appropriate test is called Mann-Whitney U test, which is the corresponding non-parametric test to a t test.
# Interestingly in R, the function is called "wilcox.test() as three people defined this approach: Mann, Whitney and Wilcox.
